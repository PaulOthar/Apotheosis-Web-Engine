# Apotheosis-Web-Engine

Apotheosis is a simple graphics engine that runs entirely in plain JavaScript.<br>
It is bound by tile logic and my specific design, but it is capable of rendering a large open world witheout the need of loading screens.

Anyone can test it witheout downloading or installing anything, since it just runs on a simple page [here](https://paulothar.github.io/Apotheosis-Web-Engine/).

You may change the rendering technique by just clicking in the side panel's buttons, under the header "Screen renderer".<br>
The same goes for the Mini-view, if you wish to see two different renderers at the same time, under the "Mini-view renderer" header.
